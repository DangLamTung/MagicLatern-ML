# Kodak Tri-X 400: contrasty b&w, deep blacks, visible grain.
#
# Tri-X at box speed: 48,26 puts the shadows down fast, 176,196 keeps a long
# straight middle, and the shoulder at 251 means the highlights still hold.
# All three per-channel curves are the identity because SAT 0 has already
# thrown the colour away -- a coloured curve here would only reintone the
# grey.
