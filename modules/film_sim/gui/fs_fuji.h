/*
 * A Fuji recipe as this camera can hold it.
 *
 * The field set and the ranges are Fuji's, taken from their X-T4 manual index
 * for the IMAGE QUALITY SETTING menu -- not invented. A recipe on a Fuji body
 * is not a screen of its own: it is a bundle of those individual menu items,
 * saved in a C1..C7 slot. That is what this is: the bundle, saved as a .fs,
 * because a .fs is this module's C-slot.
 *
 * Three fields a real recipe carries cannot be honoured here and are NOT
 * offered, rather than offered as knobs that do nothing:
 *
 *   DYNAMIC RANGE   raises ISO and pulls highlights before digitising; on an
 *                   8-bit JPEG the headroom is already gone
 *   CLARITY         needs a graded-luma ring; designed, measured, reverted
 *   HIGH ISO NR     Canon's NR lives in the picture style; not driven yet
